# UnityMaze

A Unity remake of PyMaze/CSMaze, with controller and VR support

**Note: Unlike [CSMaze](https://github.com/TollyH/CSMaze), UnityMaze is *not* a perfect recreation of the original [PyMaze](https://github.com/TollyH/pymaze). It is an approximation that attempts to get as close as possible whilst still utilising Unity's features.**
